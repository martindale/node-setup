== INSTALLING A NODE ==

1. turn off node
2. connect your node to your installing machine via ethernet cable
3. set your installing machines ip to 192.168.2.1, subnet is 255.255.255.0
4. startup sudo ./dnsmasq_tftp_osx.sh from your node-setup directory
5. startup the node ATTN: press f12 if you already installed the ptn system on the node (to make it network boot)

== Preseed ==

The preseed must be seeded through url in the pxelinux.cfg/default
The deploy procedure now properly passes through, while deploying
through dnsmasq and lighttpd

The right way to do it is to put it in the root of the initrd.


== Hostname conventions ==

we're going to use a sha1 hash based on the nic mac and the date


== Mass installation ==

for mass installing we cannot use the inet for retrieving the packages
therefore you need to use rsync to mirror the ubuntu packages

== darkstat ==

the new version should support multiple interfaces. it's not yet in
the ubuntu repo, so ideally we should start our own protonet repo

== FAQ ==
Q. TFTP is running but network boot complains about missing tftp servers?
A. 
   * Make sure your node is connected to your comp through ethernet
   * Make sure the ethernet device has 192.168.2.1 as ip
   * Make sure you connect the device _before_ you run tftp. Otherwise tftp
     will bind to the first available device, which is probably be your
     wireless.
