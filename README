== Preseed ==

The preseed must be seeded through url in the pxelinux.cfg/default
currently I use my host at flyingseagull.de/assets/preseed.cfg

The right way to do it is to put it in the root of the initrd.


== Hostname conventions ==

we're going to use a sha1 hash based on the nic mac and the date


== Mass installation ==

for mass installing we cannot use the inet for retrieving the packages
therefore you need to use rsync to mirror the ubuntu packages
